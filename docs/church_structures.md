Open Church Management is currently designed to accommodate data for low church, non rigid, loose hierarchy churches such as baptist, other denominations can attempt to use it as well, however more bespoke updates may be necessary to fit the denomination's specific needs.

## Hierarchies 
The Open Church Management tool comes with standardised user hierarchies. These hierarchy groups are defined minimally to avoid confusion, and to allow more flexibility with role definitions. 
The default roles are as follows:
- Head Pastor
- Pastors
- Leaders
- Junior Leaders
- Staff
- Members

These Roles allow for flexible permission customisation while having something for every case.

## Organisation Structures
When building this tool, we made assumptions that most churches have a similar structure to our default, which covers everything from fellowship groups, classes, services and serving departments.
